## 🌐 Welcome to My Digital Garden

Hey there! 👋 I’m KenSec, a curious explorer in the ever-evolving world of **Cybersecurity**.  
This garden is my personal space to **think in public**, capture what I learn, and share my notes, experiments, and reflections as I grow in this field.

Just like any real garden, what you’ll find here is always a **work in progress** — some ideas are seedlings, others are fully bloomed thoughts. 🌱

### 🧭 What You’ll Find Here

- **Learning Notes** — My ongoing study notes on topics like networking, ethical hacking, cryptography, and more.
- **Tools & Techniques** — Walkthroughs of tools I’m exploring (Burp Suite, Metasploit, Wireshark, etc.) and how I use them.
- **Projects & Labs** — Hands-on experiments, CTF write-ups, and personal cybersecurity projects.
- **Security Mindset** — Reflections on how to think like an attacker _and_ a defender.
- **Career Growth** — Thoughts and resources for certifications, job hunting, and continuous learning in cybersecurity.

### ✨ Why a Digital Garden?

Traditional blogs are linear — posts come and go.  
A **digital garden** is different. It’s a **living notebook**, where ideas are interconnected, updated, and constantly improved.  
My goal here is to **learn out loud**, share my thought process, and (hopefully) help others walking a similar path.
